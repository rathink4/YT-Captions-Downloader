# YT-Captions-Downloader

I made a Python script which tries to extract the captions in the video as a text file.

It makes use of python package `youtube_transcript_api` to get transcripts which contains the captions of the video.

## How to run
You need to install the api module for running this code. 

Do `pip3 install youtube_transcript_api`

Use `python3 captions_download.py *youtube video url*` in the command line to run the code.
